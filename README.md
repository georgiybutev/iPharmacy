Online pharmacy

This was my MSc project at LSBU.
You can also read the complete report of my work.

Abstract:

Healthcare Provider CMS (Medical CMS in the rest of the report) is a content management system
designed to solve specific challenge for medical institutions such as pharmacies and private / public
hospitals and clinics.

The difficulty is managing healthcare supplies such as drugs and syringes
using a unified interface part of an open source software application. There are custom software
solutions which are usually requested by the medical institution. Unfortunately these professionally
developed programs have very high cost which severely affects the institutionâ€™s budget.

This project is open source which means that it comes free of charge and it can be further improved
by the institution, professional developers, and software community. This software product is
targeting the needs of small private or public hospital / pharmacies which require management of
medical products but cannot afford to purchase commercial software.

The software interface will be used by medical staff, physicians, General Practitioners, doctors, pharmacists, and system
administrators, which means that it has to be efficient and interactive without the need for graphical
enhancement. They will be able to manage medical supplies, organise them according to their
needs, and generate warehouse reports.
